# Roadmap

## Overview

This document provides a high level overview of the direction of the AMP project.

The project follows a **time-based** release process. Until the project reaches v1.0,
we are currently releasing updates every two weeks.

Roadmap items are filed on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/appcelerator/amp/issues)
with the [`roadmap`](https://github.com/appcelerator/amp/labels/roadmap) label.
They are open to community participation:

* Take a look at the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Join the [conversation](../README.md#join-the-conversation) with other users and contributors.

Anyone can open an issue to suggest a feature or report a bug. If you see an issue
that you would like to work on, please make sure to leave a comment indicating your
intention to avoid duplication of effort. If a maintainer is already assigned to it,
you can still offer to help.
